 Cryptography Application

  This app lets you save and access files securely using a specific encryption method.   It offers options for encrypting and decrypting messages, text, binary, and files, like Veracrypt. 
Features include: 
- Encrypting files with different encryption methods, such as Salsa20, AES, and DES. 
- Safely storing encrypted files.

- Easy-to-use menu interface for simple navigation.   
Usage: 
The app will show a menu with the options "Modules" and "Binary File."
 The modules have different cryptography method to choose from while the Binary file has just one for the text/binary encryption /decryption.
